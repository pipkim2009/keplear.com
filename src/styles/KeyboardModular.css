/**
 * Keyboard CSS Architecture Improvement Summary:
 *
 * Original Keyboard.css: 710 lines
 * Broken down into 4 focused modules:
 *
 * 1. KeyboardContainer.css - Container, header, responsive layout (~130 lines)
 * 2. KeyboardLayout.css - Keyboard layout, white/black keys (~140 lines)
 * 3. KeyboardHighlighting.css - Scale/chord key highlighting (~150 lines)
 * 4. KeyboardControls.css - Octave controls, scrollbars (~115 lines)
 *
 * Total: ~535 lines (25% reduction through deduplication and organization)
 *
 * Next steps for keyboard architecture:
 * - Extract color values to design tokens
 * - Consider CSS modules for dynamic key states
 * - Optimize animations and transitions
 * - Create keyboard-specific utility classes
