3. Select your preferred area to practice

#### Step 5: Apply the Scale
1. Click the **"Apply Scale"** button
2. The scale notes light up on your instrument
3. The scale appears in your "Applied Scales" list

### Multiple Scales

**You can apply multiple scales at the same time!**

**Example Use Case**:

## Generating Melodies

### What is Melody Generation?

Melody generation creates a random sequence of notes based on your selections (notes, scales, and chords). It's like rolling dice but with musical intelligence.

### Generation Parameters

#### BPM (Beats Per Minute)
- **What it is**: The speed of your melody
- **Range**: 1 to 999 BPM
- **Default**: 120 BPM
- **How to adjust**: Type a number or use +/- buttons

**Guidelines**:
- **40-60 BPM**: Very slow (beginner practice)
- **60-80 BPM**: Slow (learning new scales)
- **80-120 BPM**: Moderate (comfortable practice)
- **120-180 BPM**: Fast (technique building)
- **180+ BPM**: Very fast (advanced speed drills)

#### Beats (Number of Notes)
- **What it is**: How many notes in your melody
- **Range**: 1 to 100 beats
- **Default**: 5 beats
- **How to adjust**: Type a number or use +/- buttons

**Guidelines**:
- **1-5 beats**: Short patterns (quick practice)
- **5-10 beats**: Medium phrases (typical practice)
- **10-20 beats**: Long phrases (ear training)
- **20+ beats**: Extended melodies (advanced practice)

#### Chord Mode

Two modes determine how notes are selected:

##### Arpeggiator Mode (Default)
**What it does**: Plays one note at a time, randomly selected from:
- Your manually selected notes
- Notes from applied scales
- Individual notes from applied chords

**Best for**:
- Single-note melody practice
- Scale exercises
- Melodic ear training
- Fast technical passages

**Example Output**:
```
Beat 1: C4
Beat 2: E4
Beat 3: G4
Beat 4: C5
Beat 5: E4
```

##### Progression Mode
**What it does**: Plays full chords from your applied chords, with optional single notes mixed in.

**How it works**:
- If you only have chords applied: Plays random chords on each beat
- If you have chords + individual notes: 50/50 chance of chord or single note

**Best for**:
- Chord progression practice
- Harmonic ear training
- Accompaniment patterns
- Jazz/contemporary styles

**Example Output**:
```
Beat 1: C Major chord (C4+E4+G4)
Beat 2: F Major chord (F4+A4+C5)
Beat 3: Single note G4
Beat 4: G7 chord (G4+B4+D5+F5)
Beat 5: C Major chord (C4+E4+G4)
```

### The "Generate Melody" Button

**What happens when you click it**:

1. **Melody Generation** (instant)
   - System collects all available notes
   - Creates random sequence based on your parameters
   - Stores melody in memory

2. **Auto-Recording** (2-5 seconds)
   - Melody plays through audio engine
   - Recording captures high-quality audio
   - Audio player appears when ready

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Button shows "Generating..." during recording
   - Selected notes and scales remain highlighted
   - Progress indicator shows recording status

**Requirements to generate**:
- At least one note selected (manual, scale, or chord)
- Or at least one chord applied (Progression Mode only)

### What Notes Get Used?

The melody generator combines notes from three sources:

1. **Manually Selected Notes**
   - Any notes you clicked directly on the instrument

2. **Scale Notes**
   - All notes from every applied scale

3. **Chord Notes** (Arpeggiator Mode only)
   - Individual notes from applied chords
   - In Progression Mode, chords are kept as groups

**Example**:
```
Manual selections: C4, E4, G4
Applied scale: D Minor (D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B♭4, C5)
Applied chord: F Major (F4, A4, C5)

Combined note pool for Arpeggiator:
C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B♭4, C5 (duplicates removed)

Melody randomly chooses from these 8 notes
```

## Ear Training Features

### Show/Hide Notes

This is the core ear training feature in Sandbox Mode.

#### What It Does

**Show Notes Mode** (default):
- Notes highlight as they play
- You can see what's being played
- Great for learning and initial practice

**Hide Notes Mode**:
- Notes don't highlight during playback
- You must identify notes by ear
- Perfect for testing your skills

#### How to Use for Ear Training

**Basic Ear Training Workflow**:

1. **Generate a melody** with your chosen notes/scales
2. **Watch and listen** with notes visible (Show mode)
3. **Click "Hide Notes"** button
4. **Play the melody again** - try to identify notes by ear
5. **Click notes on the instrument** that you think are playing
6. **Click "Show Notes"** to verify your guesses
7. **Repeat** until you can identify all notes correctly

**Progressive Difficulty**:

**Beginner**:
- Use 3-5 notes only
- Slow tempo (60-80 BPM)
- Short melodies (3-5 beats)
- Simple scale (Pentatonic)

**Intermediate**:
- Use full scale (7-8 notes)
- Moderate tempo (100-120 BPM)
- Medium melodies (5-10 beats)
- More complex scales (Major, Minor)

**Advanced**:
- Use multiple scales
- Fast tempo (140+ BPM)
- Long melodies (15+ beats)
- Chromatic or complex scales

### Tips for Effective Ear Training

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with just 2-3 notes you can easily distinguish
2. **Use Intervals**: Practice recognizing the distance between notes
3. **Sing Along**: Hum or sing the melody to internalize it
4. **Daily Practice**: Even 5 minutes daily improves ear significantly
5. **Track Progress**: Notice how many attempts it takes to identify correctly
6. **Use Scales**: Scales provide context that helps recognition
7. **Try Different Instruments**: Each has a different timbre for variety
